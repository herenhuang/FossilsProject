                        <h4>
                        Have you ever seen a horseshoe crab? A horseshoe crab is a modern relative of the extinct trilobites. But what exactly is a trilobite? And why are they one of the most important organisms in Earth’s history?</h4> <p>
                        <br>Trilobites are one earliest known groups of arthropods, and are an extremely diverse group of metazoans found from the fossil record of the early Cambrian.  They existed over 520 million years ago in the Earth’s ancient seas, and went extinct during the mass extinction at the end of the Permian about 250 million years ago.</p>
                        <p>
                        They have three longitudinal lobes: a central axial lobe, and two pleural lobes, and that’s where the name trilobite comes from, meaning three-lobed. These remarkable, hard-shelled, segmented creatures have both multiple body segments and jointed legs. However, the legs, antennae, and other finer structures of trilobites are only rarely mountain. 
                        </p><p>
                        Over the course of their long history, they have inhabited a wide range of marine environments, from reefs to abyssal depths. In addition, trilobites have evolved several different life strategies, from burrowing to swimming; these are reflected in their varied appearances, or morphologies.
                        </p><p>
                        The presence of trilobites is one of the diagnostic features of the Paleozoic Era, the first era to exhibit a proliferation of complex lifeforms, establishing the foundation of life as it is today. 

                        Identification of the 'Atlantic' and 'Pacific' trilobite faunas in North America and Europe implied the closure of the Iapetus Ocean (producing the Iapetus suture), thus providing important supporting evidence for the theory of continental drift.
                        </p><p>
                            Trilobites have been important in estimating the rate of speciation during the period known as the Cambrian Explosion because they are the most diverse group of metazoans known from the fossil record of the early Cambrian. They are also excellent stratigraphic markers of the Cambrian period, as most of the Cambrian stratigraphy is based on the use of trilobite marker fossils.
                        </p>

                        <h4>
                        When we think of the Carboniferous period, which occurred some 350 to 300 million years ago, we usually think of the vast swamps that over time created the basis of todayâ€™s coal and natural gas reserves. But the Carboniferous period was important for life on Earth because it was when the very first amphibians started to appear.</h4> <p>
                        <br>They evolved from the rhipidistia, a bony fish that was lobe finned, which meant it had limb-like fins that were thick and muscular. The rhipidistia was alive for most of the Devonian.
It later evolved into the first tetrapods of the late Devonian. These four-legged fish slowly lost their internal gills as they progressed into the first true amphibians.</p>
                        <p>
                        An amphibian mostly spends its time on land, but they also need water to breed and to lay their eggs into. Their newborn hatchlings first underwater and breathe through gills. These gills disappear as they mature and start breathing air.  Amphibians are the first backboned animals and are of importance to evolution because their limbs were specifically designed to be used on land. 
                        </p><p>
                        From the late Carboniferous to the early Permian, amphibians dominated the land
They can be divided into two groups: lepospondyls and temnospondyls
Lepospondyls were smaller and were strange looking while temnospondyls were bigger and had a more reptile look to it.
                        </p><p>
                        Most of these amphibians here would be considered lepospondyls.
                        Evolutionary pushes for amphibians were changes in temperature, ocean salinity and hypoxia. The theory of droughts influenced animals to be more terrestrial, which further pushed evolution. Predation, diseases, parasites and competition were also factors in the evolution of the tetrapods.
                        </p><p>
                            Evolutionary pulls were exciting opportunities to fill a niche that no other animal could fill at the time. Amphibians could experience better temperatures, a lack of competition and also a lack of predation.Amphibians developed unique adaptations that included eyes on their head, more mobility with their neck, a fused sacrum, and a rib cage that could support their central body mass. As well as gaining adaptations, they lost previous adaptation such as gills and tail fins among other traits that were no longer necessary.
